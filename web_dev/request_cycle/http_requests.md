What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
HTTP POST requests supply additional data from the client (browser) to the server in the message body. In contrast, GET requests include all required data in the URL. GET is used to send publicly available information while POST is used to send sensitive information such as passwords.

Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies are used to store information, reducing the amount of information that needs to be sent each time a page is accessed.

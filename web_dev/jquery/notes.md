I'm going to spend one and a half hours studying jQuery on codeacademy.com and a half hour studying jQuery on khanacademy.org (in order to get exposed to different resources).

Both these resources incorporate quizzing at regular intervals, so they will take care of that for me. Breaks are important because they give your mind a chance to rest and also to solidify the knowledge that you just acquired.

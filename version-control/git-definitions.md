# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a means of creating different versions of a project. It is useful in that it allows multiple developers to work on different aspects of a project independently and coordinate their work.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a division within a master branch that is used for version control. Anytime a new git repository is created, the first branch is the master. Any additional branches created after that are used to create different versions of the project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a version of a project that is uploaded into a git repository. It is akin to saving one's work. Once a version is committed, it can be shared with others and/or merged into the main project. A good commit message has the following features:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is an issue that may occur if competing changes are made to the same line of a file or when a file is deleted that another person is attempting to edit.

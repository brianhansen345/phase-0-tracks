Robot Elevator Algorithm

- Once near elevator, move forward into elevator until wall is reached (Wall A).
- Until floor buttons have been located, perform the following process:
	- Scan wall to determine whether the floor buttons are on Wall A
	- If floor buttons are not present, turn left and move forward until new wall is reached (Wall B).
	- Repeat first two steps (replacing Wall B with Wall C and then Wall D)
- Identify the floor button that corresponds with the floor you want to go to and push button
- Once at desired floor with elevator door open, proceed through door.

Teeth-brushing Algorithm

- Use left hand to grab toothbrush
- Use right hand to grab toothpaste
- Use right hand to squeeze 0.5 oz of toothpaste across the tops of the toothbrush's bristles
- Use right hand to put toothpaste back into cabinet
- Use left hand to run bristles of toothbrush across teeth. Divide teeth into 12 parts: top/bottom row, external/interal sides, left/right/front. Run bristles across teeth 8 times before moving on.
- Spit into sink
- Use left hand to put toothbrush back into cabinet
- Congratulate oneself on a job well done
